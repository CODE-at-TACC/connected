1. Insert the CR1220 Coin Cell Battery into the battery holder of the PCF8523 RTC Module with the positive (+) side of the battery away from the circuit board.

2. Insert onside of the STEMMA QT cable with the flat side of the connector away from the circuit board into either of the two STEMMA QT connectors ports on the PCF8523 RTC module.

3. Plug the other end of the STEMMA QT cable with the flat side of the connector away from the circuit board into either of the two STEMMA QT connector ports of the Cybedeck board.
